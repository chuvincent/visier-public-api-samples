# Visier API samples
A collection of limited-scope sample applications and snippets using public Visier APIs

## Structure
The samples are organized first by functional area and then by language and then (optionally) by major library. For example, you will find the OAuth 2.0 three-legged authentication sample for [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) under:
```
authentication
    oauth-code
        javascript
            reactjs
```

### Functional Areas
* [Authentication](authentication) provides samples showing the various methods by which users can authenticate against the Visier platform

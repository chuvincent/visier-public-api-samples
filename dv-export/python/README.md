# TODO - finish the README
To run the script in the repo
- Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies according to `requirements.txt`
- Fill values in `.env`
- Run `main.py`

If you already have an export ID, you can provide it in the `.env` file. DV numbers are then optional.
